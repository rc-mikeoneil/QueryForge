## 🔍 Why Documents Are Archived

Documents are moved to the archive when they:
1. Are implementation plans that have been completed
2. Are planning documents that may not be implemented immediately
3. Contain historical context but are superseded by current documentation
4. Would clutter the main docs directory but have archival value

## 📖 How to Use Archived Documents

### For Historical Context
Archived implementation plans provide valuable insight into:
- Original design decisions and rationale
- Evolution of features over time
- Lessons learned during implementation
- Architecture trade-offs considered

### For Future Reference
Planning documents in the archive:
- May be implemented in future releases
- Provide comprehensive requirements analysis
- Document potential enhancements
- Serve as templates for similar work

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Do not use archived documents as current references** - Always check the main docs directory
- **Archived documents may contain outdated information** - Implementation may have changed
- **Breaking changes** - Archived implementations may not reflect current API signatures
- **Historical accuracy** - Documents preserved as-is for historical record

## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

```
Active Documentation → Superseded/Completed → Archived → [Retained for Historical Value]
```

Documents in the archive are retained indefinitely for historical reference but are not actively maintained.
