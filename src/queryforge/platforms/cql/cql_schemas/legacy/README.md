# Legacy Content

## Overview
This directory contains legacy CrowdStrike Query Language syntax documentation that has been superseded by the current CQL syntax.

## Contents
- `event-search/` - Legacy Event Search syntax mappings and documentation

## Status
**DEPRECATED** - This content is maintained for historical reference and migration purposes only.

## Purpose
The legacy syntax was used in earlier versions of CrowdStrike's query language. This content is isolated in its own directory to:
1. Preserve historical documentation
2. Support migration from legacy to current CQL syntax
3. Allow easy removal if no longer needed

## Migration
If you are using legacy Event Search syntax, refer to the current CQL documentation in:
- `/cql_schemas/functions/` - Current CQL function definitions
- `/cql_schemas/operators/` - Current operator documentation

## Removal
This directory can be safely removed if legacy syntax support is no longer required. Simply delete the entire `/cql_schemas/legacy/` directory.
